#Objectives:
#• Sign Up:
#• Allow a user to ”create an account” by providing a full name and password.
#• The user must enter the password twice when creating account for verification.
#• Store the user information to check at Log-In.
#• Log-In:
#• Query the user for a username and password and verify the information is
#correct according to the ”accounts database”.
#• If the user attempts to login 3 times with incorrect credentials, then the
#program will display a message and close.
#• After logging in, display the interface for the right type of account.

# Used to import the webdriver from selenium
from selenium import webdriver 
import os

# Get the path of chromedriver which you have install

def startBot(username, password, url):
	path = "C:\\Users\\hp\\Downloads\\chromedriver"
	
	# giving the path of chromedriver to selenium webdriver
	driver = webdriver.Chrome(path)
	
	# opening the website in chrome.
	driver.get(url)
	
	# find the id or name or class of
	# username by inspecting on username input
	driver.find_element_by_name(
		"id/class/name of username").send_keys(username)
	
	# find the password by inspecting on password input
	driver.find_element_by_name(
		"id/class/name of password").send_keys(password)
	
	# click on submit
	driver.find_element_by_css_selector(
		"id/class/name/css selector of login button").click()
